**The newly designed MDGuidelines Durations tool presents return to activity timeframes in a simplified, interactive dashboard to help manage patient cases.**
- Explore duration tables, return-to-work analytics, and case predictions from a single integrated dashboard.

- Set recovery expectations with patients, learn what to ask when claims go longer than expected, or calculate personalized duration estimates based on individual factors like age, sex, and comorbidities.

- View all relevant duration milestones on the interactive timeline.

- Bookmark duration pages to easily access information later, or copy/print them to share across your workflow.

## Review Frequently Asked Questions about the Durations tool.

##### What is the Durations tool?
The Duraons tool, which replaces Duraon Views, helps manage paent cases by presenng
return-to-acvity meframes for ill and injured individuals in a simplified, interacve dashboard. You can quickly see how long it takes someone to recover from a condion or procedure, guide
paent care and set recovery expectaons, and determine when a case needs addional support.

##### Why are you changing Duration Views?
With simplified language, integrated content, and expanded funconalies like bookmarking and
copying to clipboard, the new Duraons tool streamlines case management and empowers you
to make informed recommendaons on a paent’s path to recovery.

##### When will the Durations tool be available?
September 30, 2024. At that time the Duration Views tool will be retired.

##### What do the Early, Expected, and Evaluate terms mean?
These terms replace the physiological minimum, optimum, and maximum labels. They
represent uncomplicated cases and depend on activity level in most cases.
- Early return physiological minimum: represents the minimum recovery time most
individuals require to return to activity or work at the same performance level as prior
to injury, illness, or surgery.
- Expected return physiological optimum: represents the point in time when most
individuals are likely to be able to return to activity, assuming optimal management
and no significant complications/comorbidities.
- Evaluate return physiological maximum: represents the point in time when
additional case information should be requested to determine if/when the individual
may be able to return to activity.

##### What does “Real World Average” mean?
This represents the population median including cases of varying complexity and care
management. It is a statistical average calculated using MDGuidelines’ proprietary database
of injury and illness claims.

##### What does “Analytic Prediction” mean?
You can calculate a return-to-activity analytic prediction using case-specific factors like age
and comorbid conditions based on MDGuidelines’ predictive modeling algorithm. 

##### How should I pick an activity level?
On your first use of the new tool, you’ll be asked to set a “default” activity level. You can adjust
the activity level at any time using the interactive slider or change the default using the gear
icon. If you don’t know which activity level to select, open the Job Title Explorer tool by clicking
the badge icon, searching a job title, and applying the activity level to the speedometer.

##### How do I find related information about a particular health topic?
Click the “Related Topics” dropdown above the Activity Level slider. You can find additional
details for each duration value by selecting the “Read More” link in the lower right area of the
page. In the Duration Table view, you can also view the Length of Disability and Factors
Influencing Duration content, toggling between dierent topics as applicable.

##### Does the timeline show calendar days or business days?
The timeline represents calendar days, inclusive of the start date. For example, if the
selected start date is Tuesday, October 1 and the expected return is 7 days, the expected
return-to-activity date would be Tuesday, October 8.

##### I use the MDGuidelines duration APIs – will my access be changing?
No, the duration APIs are not aected by this update.

##### Where can I find the duration tables?
Duration tables can be accessed beneath the speedometer display. You can choose to view
a single table at a time or toggle to the Compare Tables view to see all tables/treatments
associated with a diagnosis or procedure.

##### How do the new duration tables dier from the old ones?
There are two major changes reflected in the new duration tables: a new terminology: Early,
Expected, Evaluate, Real World Average, Analytic Prediction; b rows and columns are
swapped for ease of reference by activity level.

##### Have the duration values changed?
No, there are no changes to duration value related to this update. Physiological durations
Early Return/Expected Return/Evaluate Return continue to be updated twice a year,
typically in the spring and fall, and population durations Real World Average and Analytic
Prediction are updated once a year, typically in the summer.
